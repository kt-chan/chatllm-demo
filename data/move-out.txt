About Move Out
Welcome to "Electricity Account Management". This Section contains 5 modules. Read " Move In " if you are going to move house. Don't skip " Billing & Payment " if you wish to manage your account in a more effective way. Also take time to see " Use of Electricity " for more information on electrical safety and energy efficiency. If you would vacate your premises, " Move Out " and "Deposit Refund " would be most useful to you.
