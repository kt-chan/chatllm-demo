# chatllm-demo

Hello! Welcome to HK Electric's customer service. I'm here to assist you with account operation and billing enquiries. How can I help you today? If you have any questions related to account setup, termination, relocation, or payment methods, please feel free to ask.

it is fine-tuned to support the following type of question
1. account operations (openning account, closing account, relocation）
2. bill enquiry (check bills, check statement, usage)
3. payment method (how to pay bills)

- for email: it use chain-of-thoughts (CoT) to validate question types, and then perform location checking, and then proceed to customer enquiry.  As a result, it takes more time to process the query and generate the answer, and result in better response with embedding business logics;

- for chatbot: it use conversational memory and prompt design for question answer. As a result, it is faster but more straight-forward for simple Q&A experience. It is not tailored to embed busines logics.
